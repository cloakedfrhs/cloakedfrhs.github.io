      <h2>Tagging:</h2>
      You must tag your target (and only your target) by tapping the back their wrist (where the veins are) with the back side of a spoon. Once you tag your target, you receive their target and you continue on your quest to becoming the master agent.

       

      <h2>The Art of Tagging:</h2>
      Tagging is meant to be quick, quiet, undetected, and unexpected. This is a game for Ninja's and undercover Agents

       

      <h2>You may <b>not</b> tag...</h2>
      <p>-during class or club (all after school clubs start at 3:10 and safety for the player continues until the players have left the location of either the class or club.)

      -in the presence of another agent (If any agent can attest to you being eliminated without anyone else telling them, then they may send an email to <a href='mailto:cloakedfrhs@gmail.com'>cloakedfrhs@gmail.com</a> and cancel that elimination, and any other action which ensues due to that elimination<br /><br />

      Safe Places: No tagging may never happen in ANY Tech lab, or Studio. (This includes the TV lab and studio, the booth, and music tech lab, as well as other tech labs)</p>

       

      <i>A history of past tags done with in the spirit of the game will increase your likelihood of not having your eliminations repealed, and having your own elimination defended if the legality of it is in question</i>

       

      <h2>Safety Patches:</h2>

      Temporary tattoos are hidden around the school (keep an eye out for clues on <a href='tattoos.html'>here</a>)

      You may place one complete tattoo on one of your wrist for a 24 hour immunity from all attacks (on both wrists).

      Tattoo must remain clear for those 24 hours.

       

      <h2>Physical Contact:</h2>
      No Physical Contact, this also includes the use of a blockade strategy. Any form of physical contact can result in the cancellation of a tag, or removal from the game.

       
      <h2>Game Court Cases:</h2>
      any case can be brought to a game maker for judgment (email them to <a href='mailto:cloakedfrhs@gmail.com'>cloakedfrhs@gmail.com</a>), but they reserve the right to take any action they see reasonable for the fair continuation of the game (this may include choosing to eliminate the player who has been questionably eliminated, or the player who was doing the questionable eliminations)
